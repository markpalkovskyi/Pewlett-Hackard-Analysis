By using pgAdmin tools we've got everything we need to get all the information of how many people are going to retire soon from the company. 

Summary:
AFter completing all required tusks for our assignment, we can assume that Pewlett Hackard company had a great begining with their employee but due to not accepting new employees, more than 60% of the company are getting retired within a few years or so. To improve their work abilities, the company must hire more young employees to keep their work flow.
